# Notes

Prevelant console bug was : multiple cases of styled-components initiated, with no apparent fix. Also , using styled component's library's functions really was taking a toll on visual code for no reason. Further study needed in the intricacies of styled component compositional arrangement. This project also uses <a href="https://fontawesome.com/"> Font Awsome </a> for simple design icons.
